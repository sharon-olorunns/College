Students bring the knowledge and expertise of programming, digital logic and a small amount of digital electronics to the development of small system integration projects combining program design and implementation with simple interface interfacing and breadboarding.
Each team is provided with a small ARM-based computer, a PC-based integrated development system, some electronic components and breadboarding facilities.
Students have to design, build and test integrated hardware and software systems to provide a certain required functionality.
Students also study processor and memory architectural techniques such as pipelining, superscalar architectures and caches.
