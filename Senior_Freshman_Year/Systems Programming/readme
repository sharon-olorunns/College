Students taking this module have already successfully completed modules in object-oriented Java programming and ARM assembly language programming. This module starts with a new perspective on program construction, with structured programming in C. This part of the module deals with the features of C, sound design principles for structured programming, and the necessary self-discipline required to program in a low-level language like C. Students also learn the basics of how programs are commonly implemented, with special emphasis on the layout of program data in memory. In parallel with learning C programming, the students learn about the UNIX operating system, including program development tools, interaction between C programs and the operating system.
