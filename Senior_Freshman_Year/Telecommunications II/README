This module is structured following the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model and consists of two parts.
The first part of the module focuses on the concepts and mechanisms that are employed in the 2nd layer of the OSI model, the data link layer. This layer is concerned with the delivery of data between two immediately connected devices i.e. devices that share a common physical medium. The layer coordinates the access to the physical medium and attempts to detect and correct errors introduced by the transfer of signals over the physical medium. The concepts that are employed in this layer are discussed and the students exercises that demonstrate the application of these concepts.
The second part of the module focuses on the 3rd and 4th layer of the OSI model.
