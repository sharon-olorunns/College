This module will teach the use of tools and techniques for modelling and verifying the correctness of concurrent systems, applying this through practical laboratory exercises in which small concurrent software systems are developed.

The second part of the module addresses various aspects of the design of modern operating systems. The main aim is to explore how programmers can apply a knowledge of operating system features to the design of efficient applications. This is achieved by examining common algorithms and policies used by modern operating systems, as well as the facilities provided to application programmers. This knowledge is then applied in laboratory exercises.
