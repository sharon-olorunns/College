This module examines the structure of matter from an electrical perspective dealing with conductors, dielectrics and semiconductors. Concepts of electrical charge, Electric and Magnetic fields are also examined. With this material concepts of voltage, current, impedance in electrical circuits are explored. Circuit elements such as the resistor, capacitor, inductor, the semiconductor diode and transistors are examined as well as ideal and practical ac and dc supplies. Methods of analyzing electrical circuits consisting of the above components are examined. In the lab sessions students are expected to build electronic circuits and explain their operation.
