Write a Java program which converts (user entered) plain text to cipher text using a substitution cipher (in which plain text letters are randomly assigned to cipher text letters).  Note that a Substitution Cipher replaces plaintext with cipher-text. The most common substitution ciphers replace single characters of plaintext with predefined single characters of cipher-text (e.g. the plain-text character `a' might be replaced by cipher text character 'q', 'b' might be replaced by 'x', 'c' by 'k' and so on).  Each plain-text character should be replaced by a different cipher-text character.
